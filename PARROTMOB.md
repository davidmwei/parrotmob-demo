# ParrotMob Coding Challenge: Customer Support Agent Interface

Built using React with dummy data located in JSONs.

## Instructions
To run this demo locally, please download all files locally into a directory of choice. Navigate to the directory and run `npm start`.

You can refresh the page to randomly choose one of three customers: David, Peter, and Osa.
